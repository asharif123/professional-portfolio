# 02 Professional Portfolio

This portfolio represents a summary of my background and accomplishments.

It's divided among the following sections:

- About: Contains a profile picture and a summary of my work background plus goals.

- A works section showcasing some of my best projects.

- A footer section containing my email, Github and LinkedIn Profile.

I have learned to utilizing various HTML and CSS features such as flexbox to complete this project and make it both desktop/mobile responsive.

These 2 screenshots represent the about me section. Clicking on "About" shows a summary of my works and clicking on "Contact" takes user to the footer containing my contact information.
